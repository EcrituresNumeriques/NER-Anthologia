# NER-Anthologia

Joint project with Monica Berti (University of Leipzig) for the annotation of named entities in the epigrams of the **Anthologia Graeca**.

This repository includes:
- a CSV file containing Greek texts with fields for epigram number, greek text, and text URL
- a Jupyter notebook used to generate the CSV

The goal is to build a reproducible and well-documented NER workflow, supporting digital scholarly editing and linked open data integration (e.g. Wikidata).
